To tackle this problem we aim to use machine learning, Our solution involves collecting datasets of
phishing and legitimate URLs, extracting key features from these URLs (such as length, number of
hyphens, page rank,web Traffic, domain information etc), and train machine learning model to
differentiate between phishing and legitimate URLs.
The model is then integrated into a web application. This web app allows users to input URLs and
receive real-time predictions on their legitimacy and gives the necessary description about it.
